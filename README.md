# SE-Assignment-5
Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.
When wanting to download Visual Studio Code for windows 11 you visit the official visial studio code website and then proceed to look for the download button. Click on it then you select the version that’s compatible with Windows 11.
After that you open the installer file. Locate the downloaded file in your Downloads folder. It should be named something like "VSCodeSetup.exe". Double-click on it to start the installation process. Next, accept the terms and conditions by checking the box and clicking "Next".
Select the folder where you want Visual Studio Code to be installed, then click "Next".
By default, it will suggest a directory. If you’re fine with that, just proceed. Otherwise, choose a different location on your machine.
Then you install which takes a while.

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
   Add-ons known as extensions improve Visual Studio Code's capability. They can offer extra features like tools, themes, and language support.
Languages: Go, Java, Python, C++, C#, and ESLint; Tools: PowerShell, JSHint, and ESLint

• PHP XDebug debuggers.
• Vim, Sublime Text, Eclipse, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Emacs, and Atom keyboard mappings
By integrating with VS Code's user interface, instructions, and task running mechanisms, extensions make it simple to collaborate with developers of various technologies via the shared interface.
 Importing automatically
Importing files by hand is not necessary while using this extension. Simply type in the component name if you are working on a project that uses components; it will be imported immediately.
Include comments for jsdoc
This updates the code with a comments block. To utilize it, underline the opening sentence.


3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
   VS Code adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened. VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor, while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project. The user interface is divided into five main areas:
•	Editor - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
•	Primary Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
•	Status Bar - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
•	Activity Bar - Located on the far left-hand side. Lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled. You can change the position of the Activity Bar.
•	Panel - An additional space for views below the editor region. By default, it contains output, debug information, errors and warnings, and an integrated terminal. The Panel can also be moved to the left or right for more vertical space.


4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
   The Command Palette in Visual Studio Code enables users to swiftly find and apply commands.
Accessing the Command Palette can be achieved through View > Command Palette or by using keyboard shortcuts Cmd–Shift–P (Mac) or Ctrl–Shift–P (Windows).
The Command Palette can be utilized to transform selected text into title case.
Users can find specific commands by typing in relevant keywords or acronyms into the Command Palette.
The Command Palette allows for the execution of a wide range of commands, including transformation and selection functions.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - 
   The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code. 

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
The integrated terminal can run commands such as mkdir and git just like a standalone terminal.The integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code allows you to access the command line interface (CLI) within the code editor. This means you can run shell commands, build tools, git commands, etc. right inside VS Code instead of having to switch to a separate terminal app. Advantages are  convenience: No need to switch apps or windows to access the terminal, context awareness: The working directory is automatically set to your open workspace folder, theme integration: Terminal theme matches your VS Code theme for consistency.
7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
Using the New File and New Folder buttons at the top of the Explorer View is the simplest way to create files and folders in Visual Studio Code. The buttons labeled "New File" and "New Folder" have the shapes of a piece of paper and a plus sign, respectively.
Make sure you click on the subfolder before selecting the New File or New Folder options if you want to create a file or folder inside of it.



8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.
   VS Code has various settings scopes:
• User settings: These are options that are universally applicable to any VS Code instances you launch.
• Workspace settings: These are preferences that are kept within your workspace and are only activated when it is opened.Users can use the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) with Preferences or navigate to File > Preferences > Settings to locate and modify settings in VS Code. Go to Settings1.
2. In VS Code, open a project and navigate to the Settings page2.

3. To make adjustments particular to the ongoing project, choose the Workspace tab.2. Illustrations of customization:
• Modify the subject: Find "Color Theme" in the settings and choose your favorite theme.
• Change the font size: Look up "Font Size" and change the number.






9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?To set up a debugging configuration, you need to create a launch.json file in the .vscode folder of your project.
You can create a launch.json file by clicking on the Debugging icon in the activity bar and then selecting the gear icon to open the Debugging Configuration. From there, select the type of configuration you want to use (e.g. Node.js, Chrome, etc.). add a breakpoint.
Once you have set up your debugging configuration and added breakpoints, you can start the debugger by clicking on the green play button in the Debugging panel, or by using the keyboard shortcut F5. 
When the debugger is running, you can step through your code using the step over, step into, and step out buttons in the Debugging panel, or by using the keyboard shortcuts F10, F11, and Shift + F11 respectively.
When the debugger is paused, you can inspect the values of variables in your code by hovering over them in the editor or by using the Watch panel. 


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
   Launch Visual Studio Code, then launch a new terminal and use the following command to create an empty folder: mkdir gfg. 
Next, use the following command to start a new React project: npx create-react-app gfgreact, after opening our folder in the new terminal.
Then, use the command "git init" to initialize the git repository. 

Open the App.js file in the src folder of the React project after going to it and adding some code. 
Return to the vs code terminal and use this command to see the git repository's status: git status 
Then use this command to add all changes to git: Add git. and use this command to see the status: git status 
Next, use the following command to commit all changes: git commit -m "change the app.js file" and use this command to see how things are progressing: git status

 Then use this command to add all changes to git: Add git. and use this command to see the status: git status
Next, use the following command to commit all changes: git commit -m "change the app.js file" and use this command to see how things are progressing: git status
These are the modifications we did to the local system, but we also want to submit the project we made in your system to GitHub. To do so, just follow the instructions below:

1. Visit GitHub
2. Next, select your profile.
3. Choose the folder containing your repositories. Next, click the "New" option to create a new repository with the name GFGRepo. After confirming that the repository was established successfully, copy the repository link.
Next, access the VS Code Terminal.
